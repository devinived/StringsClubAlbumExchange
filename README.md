Strings Club Album Exchange Bot

This is a bot written in Python using discord.py. It serves the purpose of randomizing albums in an exchange (secret-santa style), and giving each participant an album to review.

To see this in action, join Strings Club! https://discord.gg/strings-club-735499608876253244 | We love to talk about all things music.
